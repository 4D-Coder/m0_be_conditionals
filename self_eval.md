# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- Still a bit iffy on higher applications of these operators (especially ones like the modulo operator), but I am definitely confident about their basic definitions and uses.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- Much like comparison operators, I feel like I am comfortable about the ways I've had to use them thus far.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- so far, feeling pretty good, and I'm rcognizing I will improve as I'm allowed more practice.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- WAYYY longer than I thought (at least 6hrs total), as I tried to tackle all 3 challenges in this lesson. It did not line up well with my schedule, but I tried to space out my time with small breaks as much as possible and focused on taking time to understand.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
-I really need to practice research habits and balancing the productive/unproductive struggle. As far as topics go, I really need to continue practice using technical terminology, and using that terminology to as a sort of reference for what things do functionally when theyre together. (Lookin at you methods!)

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
what are glasses, and what is the 'do' function? Google and cohort teammates!
